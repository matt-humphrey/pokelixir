# Pokelixir

This is an exercise from [DockYard Academy](https://github.com/matt-humphrey/DockYard-Academy).

The aim of this exercise is to practice extracting data from APIs.

In this instance, a couple of functions have been defined to allow the user to get the stats for a specific Pokemon, or to output a list of the stats of ALL Pokemon.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `pokelixir` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:pokelixir, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/pokelixir>.
